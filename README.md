## Overview

**ProLiFIC (Procedural Lawmaking Flow in Italian Chambers)** is a comprehensive dataset documenting the Italian legislative process from 1987 to 2022, spanning from **Legislature X (1987â€“1992)** to **Legislature XVIII (2018â€“2022)**.
- ProLiFIC has been built using unstructured textual data (_preparatory works_) available in [Normattiva](https://www.normattiva.it/), the official Italian legal archive:
  - As of the time of writing, these are all the complete legislatures available in Normattiva which have been equipped with _Preparatory works_
  - We plan to update the dataset when data on newly completed legislatures will be available


Developed to support **Process Mining (PM)** analyses in legal settings, ProLiFIC aligns with recent trends in **Legal PM**:
- See, e.g., [Challenges in Legal Process Discovery](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2952/paper_302a.pdf)

ProLiFIC has been built using an automated pipeline exploiting Large Language Models (LLM), aligning with recent trends aiming at **integrating PM and LLM**. We use LLMs to convert unstructured legislative records into structured, machine-readable event logs:
- See, e.g., the workshop series on [Natural Language Processing for Business Process Management](https://sites.google.com/view/nlp4bpm2025/) and on [Generative AI for Process Mining](https://www.genai4pm2024.info/)



While PM has traditionally been used in business and industrial contexts, its application to social and legal systems has been limited. One of the reasons is the scarcity of suitable data. ProLiFIC aims to fill this gap by providing a large-scale, reproducible benchmark for legal PM and interdisciplinary research at the intersection of **law, data science**, and **governance**.

## Repository Contents

This repository includes:

- **`ProLiFIC_metadata.csv`**  
  Metadata for each legislative case (one row per law), including title, publication dates, institutional context, and summaries.

- **`ProLiFIC_event_log.csv`**  
  A procedural event log detailing the legislative trajectory of each case: timestamps, activities, and actors (committees, chambers) involved.

- **`ProLiFIC_EDA.ipynb`**  
  A Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis of the ProLiFIC dataset. It includes loading and merging metadata with event logs, parsing timestamps, generating descriptive statistics, calculating case durations, and producing visualizations to support process mining and institutional research.

- **`ProLiFIC_error_cases.txt`**  
  A plain-text list of `case_id`s that were either corrected or excluded due to formatting and structural issues from legislatures Xâ€“XVIII.

### `ProLiFIC_event_log.csv`

Each row corresponds to a legislative event. The fields are:

| Attribute       | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `case_id`       | Unique identifier for the law (foreign key to `ProLiFIC_metadata.csv`)      |
| `chamber`       | Legislative chamber: `Camera` (Lower House) or `Senato` (Upper House)       |
| `activity_it`   | Type of legislative action in Italian (e.g., `presentazione`, `approvazione`)|

### `ProLiFIC_error_cases.txt`

A plain-text list of problematic `case_id`s, mainly from legislatures Xâ€“XVIII (1987â€“2022). These were either:

- **Corrected** manually (e.g., malformed HTML, inconsistent dates), or  
- **Excluded** due to irrecoverable structural issues (e.g., missing event chains).

---

### `ProLiFIC_EDA.ipynb`

A Jupyter notebook that demonstrates:

- How to load and join the metadata and event logs via `case_id`
- Filtering and cleaning methods (e.g., by legislature, date, chamber)
- Prepare data for process mining with `pm4py`
- Generate visualizations to compute descriptive statistics and explore temporal patterns

```python
import pandas as pd

metadata = pd.read_csv("data/ProLiFIC_metadata.csv")
event_log = pd.read_csv("data/ProLiFIC_event_log.csv")

# Join metadata and event logs on case_id
df = pd.merge(event_log, metadata, on="case_id")
```
